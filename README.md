# yhatt/electron-playground

### What's this repo?

This is my playground of [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/). For feedback to owned OSS project [Marp](https://github.com/yhatt/marp), I would make an Electron app including several Front-end web developments for my study.

### I'm trying to

- **markdown-it renderer to [Incremental DOM](https://github.com/google/incremental-dom)**

#### :sweat:

- Continuous integration with [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/)
- Unit & E2E Test with [AVA](https://github.com/avajs/ava) + ES2015 (powered by [Babel](https://babeljs.io/))

### In future I want to try

- [Web Components](https://www.w3.org/standards/techs/components)
- ~~[React](https://facebook.github.io/react/index.html)~~
